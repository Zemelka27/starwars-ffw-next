# FFW Star Wars Challenge 2023

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) which displays Star Wars character information in a visually appealing way.

Challenge description:

Please implement a Star Wars themed React App. The App should connect to https://swapi.dev/ and display the retrieved data. Axios (https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) would be a good choice for making the requests. Please do not invest more than 4-8 hours on this. Also, keep the design effort to a minimum and use a pragmatic approach to your app's design. If you need to cut anything from the implementation or make any assumptions due to time constraints, please make a note and let us know later when presenting your solution to us. Treat this as a showcase for your working style and as a chance to show off your skills as a developer. Of course you don’t have to overdo it. In the end, we know that you have to work on it next to your daily life. A simple solution is perfectly fine. Should you hit a roadblock don’t hesitate to ask us. Please commit your code to a public github repository and provide us with the link.
